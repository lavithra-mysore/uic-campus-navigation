# uic-campus-navigation
Code to find shortest path between two buildings at UIC campus.

Performed back-end operations for a program that uses a college map to build graphs, and computing the shortest weighted path between two points using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.

The program focused on two features of a map: Nodes and Ways. It was a console-based C++ program to input UIC East Campus map and navigate between buildings via footways
